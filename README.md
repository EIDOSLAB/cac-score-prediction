# DeepLearning CalciumDetection


Coronary artery calcifications are often overlooked in routine clinical practice, and even for an experienced radiologist it is difficult to detect calcium from an X-ray image by eye compared to a CT scan.
Chest x-rays are obtained much more commonly than CT scans at a much lower cost; for this reason an automatic radiographic image analysis system could be of fundamental importance for the early detection of calcium.
Through this work we aim to build a process, based on convolutional neural networks, capable of predicting the presence or absence of coronary calcium from chest radiographs, evaluating the performance in terms of accuracy obtained.
